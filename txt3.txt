Oscars 2023 Shortlists: SS Rajamouliâ€™s RRR advances in only one category, Last Film Show is one step closer to International Feature nomination .The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Thursday announced the shortlists in 10 categories for the upcoming Oscars. Despite an intensive campaign, director SS Rajamouli's RRR managed to advance in only one category, Music (Original Song), for the song "Naatu Naatu". The film had been submitted for consideration in several categories, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, among others. It should be noted that while RRR failed to feature in any other list barring Original Song, it still has a chance to bag nominations in the other major categories, including Best Picture and Best Director. This would be a first for an Indian film.
