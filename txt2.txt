Avatar The Way of Water: James Cameron’s sequel feels like badly written fan fiction filled with the worst Hollywood clichés Grand visuals and stunning spectacles that have wafer-thin plots and crater-sized plotholes are getting exhausting to watch. This year itself, we’ve seen history on steroids with SS Rajamouli’s RRR and Ayan Mukerji’s visually impressive but abysmal Brahmastra -- just to name a few of the ‘blockbusters’ that have swept India, and in Rajamouli's case, the world. The latest visual rage is the Hollywood blockbuster James Cameron’s Avatar: The Way of Water, a sequel to the 2009 sci-fi action film that despite its flaws, was actually fun to watch. The first film had some amount of character distinction and development, with special mention for Zoe Saldana’s Neytiri, a fierce N’avi (the alien brood of the fictional moon Pandora), and her relationship with the human hybrid Jake Sully. Together, they formed the core of the story, mixed with themes of environment and colonisation. It was fine, and it should have ended there.
